I'm a results driven **Web developer** with a focus on creating efficient, high quality and user-friendly web applications. 

I absolute love writing *__SOLID__* code and using *__design patterns__*. 

I also like writing **unit tests** (mostly `PHPUnit` and `Jest`) and **BDD** (`Gherkin`, `Cucumber`, `Selenium`). For my part, I consider that these tools are absolutely convenient. Don't you think so ?
